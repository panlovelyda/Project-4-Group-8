# Bank Marketing Predict

## Dataset
Bank Marketing Data Set  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing  
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution,The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

## Prepare
1. Read data from csv to Python Pandas dataframe.
2. Drop the null row.
3. Create sqlite database and table 'marketing'.
4. Save data to database.

## Data Model Implementation
1. Read data from sqlite database to Python Pandas dataframe.
2. Drop the null row again.
3. Check the unique values in each cloumn.
4. Splite data into features and target arrays.
6. Splite data into training and testing dataset.
7. Create standard scaler and fit it.
8. Scare the data.
9. Define the deep neural net model and compile it.
10. Train the model.
11. Evaluate the model using the test data.

## Data Model Optimisation
1. Decreased the first hidden layer neurons from 7 to 3, the second hidden layer neurons from 14 to 6.
2. Added the third hidden layer neurons.
3. Used different activation function for the hidden layer, from ReLU to Tanh.

## Conclusion
Tanh is better than ReLu, and three hidden layers better than two. the best accuracy was composed of Tanh and 3/6/12 layer
